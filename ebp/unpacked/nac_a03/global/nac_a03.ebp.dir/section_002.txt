Longest serving merchant in Nalbina, right here!
Loved for years, and business's never been better!
Take a look!
{/dialog}

{instant}{npc:681}
The Imperials have taken a liking to our shop.
Business is great! Care for a weapon or two?
{/dialog}

{dialog 7}
{instant}{npc:687}
I've heard rumors of the creatures that lurk in
the lands about Nalbina. Childrens' tales,
compared to the legendary fiends of Archadia!{wait}
For instance, did you know that a great palace
lies buried deep within the earth to the south of
the capital? Well, within that palace...{wait}
...there sleeps a terrible wyrm! Frightening, isn't
it? And if it really exists...there's a fight best
avoided. Let sleeping wyrms lie, as they say!
{/dialog}

{dialog 8}
{instant}{npc:687}
You there, you sure you aren't a Rozarrian spy,
hmm? No, on second thought, you don't look

{dialog 9}
{instant}{npc:687}
You report any shops you see selling stolen
goods, son.{wait}
...I didn't join the army for this bloody drudgery.
What happened to glory?{wait}
I'm part of Lord Vayne's Western Armada, here to
protect the homeland from the reaching arms of
Rozarria, and I'm patrolling street stalls!{wait}
Should've taken that Rabanastre posting when
I had the chance...
{/dialog}

{dialog 10}
{instant}{npc:687}
You report any shops you see selling stolen
goods, son.{wait}
Can you believe I'm here doing this, every day?
There I was part of the Western Armada, glorious!
Victorious!{wait}
This war better start soon. I want to be a shield
for the homeland, and a sword, striking down
those Rozarrian barbarians!
{/dialog}

{dialog 11}
{instant}{npc:687}
My predecessor was transferred, leaving me to
patrol the stalls, looking for stolen goods...
quite a task, I assure you!{wait}
Hard times have driven shopkeepers to desperate
measures out here in the provinces.
{/dialog}

{dialog 12}
{instant}{npc:674}
Hold, there! No further, boy. Leave the sweating

{/dialog}

{dialog 13}
{instant}{npc:674}
Hold, there! You may be the "Hero of Nalbina,"
but you'll go no further.{wait}
We're under orders to finish the repairs to the
fortress walls before war comes, and these
Imperials mean business.
{/dialog}

{dialog 14}
{instant}{npc:676}
What? Don't know what kind of shop I'm running?
Well...truth be told, I'm a little unclear on
that myself. I sell...boxes? Yeah. Boxes.{wait}
I pick up boxes no one needs, and I sell 'em.
What? It's a living. {italic}(snort){/italic}
{/dialog}

{dialog 15}
{instant}{npc:676}
Sold a box to an Imperial the other day. Heard he
took it with 'im on some Leviathingy...then that
up and disappeared! Wonder where it went to.
{/dialog}

{dialog 16}
{instant}{npc:676}
My boxes're selling like {italic}popular{/italic} boxes to them
Imperials! Wait, you think they're usin' 'em

{/dialog}

{dialog 17}
{instant}{npc:688}
I was complaining to that fellow over there about
how rough I had it, and he gave me this suit of
armor to put on...{wait}
It's hot, it's heavy, people are yelling at me...
All right, I get it, I get it! It's tough being
an Imperial. Now can I please take this off?
{/dialog}

{dialog 18}
{instant}{npc:688}
Hey, don't be fooled by appearances...I ain't
no Imperial. This armor belongs to this guy next
to me. He puts it on me so he can loaf off!{wait}
It's hot, it's heavy... Okay, so it's tough being an
Imperial, I get it. Come to think of it, those Judges
wear armor, too, but they don't complain...{wait}
'Less they're saying it real quiet-like behind
those scary masks of theirs.
{/dialog}

{dialog 19}
{instant}{npc:688}
Hey, don't be fooled by appearances...I ain't
no Imperial. This armor belongs to this guy next
to me. He puts it on me so he can loaf off...{wait}
At least he used to. Now that war's a-comin' he
doesn't get to relax quite so much. It's hard
being an Imperial, I guess...
{/dialog}

{dialog 20}
{instant}{npc:1069}
A friend of mine's kept in the dungeons here,
so me and my buddy came to help him...{wait}
'Cept my buddy looked so needy, they thought he
was a stonemason and put him to work! Now what
do I do?
{/dialog}

{dialog 21}
{instant}{npc:1069}
I heard a rumor that someone escaped from the
dungeons here, but it weren't my friend.{wait}
See, I'm not really a stonemason. I came with my
buddy to get a friend out of the dungeons...{wait}
Maybe if he comes out on forced labor we'll get
to see 'im. That'd be nice.
{/dialog}

{dialog 22}
{instant}{npc:1069}
I'm not really a stonemason, see. I'm just here
{italic}pretending{/italic} to work, waiting for my chance
to get a friend out of the dungeons.{wait}
Not that I'd be much help if a chance {italic}did{/italic} come
along...this work's exhausting!
{/dialog}

{dialog 23}
{instant}{npc:1069}
Yaaaar, it's hot! Retreat for the shade!
Retreeeeeat!
{/dialog}

{dialog 24}
{instant}{npc:1069}
Hmph. We got mistaken for stonemasons on
account of my buddy's grim appearance, that's
why. Now we gotta work out here...
{/dialog}

{dialog 25}
{instant}{npc:1069}
I've kinda gotten used to the heat, you know.
{/dialog}

{dialog 26}
{instant}{npc:1069}
We didn't come here as no stonemasons. We came
to rescue one of our friends stuck in the dungeons!{wait}
But...my stupid seeq buddy got mistaken for a
worker...and here we are.
{/dialog}

{dialog 27}
{instant}{npc:1069}
I came here with my seeq buddy to spring a friend
out of the dungeons...but my stupid {italic}buddy{/italic} got
mistaken for a stonemason, so here we are...{wait}
'Course, we started getting good at the work,
and now the foreman thinks we're some elite
crew... What're we {italic}doing!?{/italic}
{/dialog}

{dialog 28}
{instant}{npc:1069}
I came here with my seeq buddy to spring a friend
out of the dungeons...but my stupid {italic}buddy{/italic} got
us trapped here workin' as stonemasons.{wait}
Anyhow, now that it seems like Rozarria's going
to invade, I figure it's time to be off...'cept we
can't just leave our friend in the dungeon! Tch.
{/dialog}

{dialog 29}
{instant}{npc:1069}
Wh-What? What is it? I'm still on break...
{/dialog}

{dialog 30}
{instant}{npc:1069}
Listen here, swinesnout, it's your stupid fault
we got mistaken for stonemasons. And no, it's
{italic}not{/italic} making us better people, okay? Gah!
{/dialog}

{dialog 31}

You know...I'm getting used to the heat here,
too.
{/dialog}

{dialog 32}
{/dialog}

{dialog 33}
{instant}{npc:691}
You've done it. You've stopped the Roblon.{wait}
I was afraid to tell you before, but the Roblon...
was made by my son. When I heard its description,
I knew it could be no other.{wait}
My son died two years ago in the war. Without its
master, the Roblon must have begun its rampage in
the ruins of Nabudis.
{/dialog}

{dialog 34}
{instant}{npc:691}
Hey there! Jovy!
{/dialog}

{dialog 35}
{instant}{npc:673}
Ah, Morgen. What is it? Make any progress on
that golem hunt of yours?
{/dialog}

{dialog 36}
{instant}{npc:691}
An astute guess! But much more than progress...{wait}
The hunt is finished, thanks to this boy!{wait}
You're still young yourself, Jovy. Isn't it high
time you—
{/dialog}

{dialog 37}
{instant}{npc:673}
{italic}(snort){/italic}
{/dialog}

{dialog 38}
{instant}{npc:691}
Wouldn't even let me finish my sentence. Good of
him to take an interest in the troubles of an old
man, but he can be an odd one, that Jovy.{wait}
But it's to you I owe my thanks. And a bounty,
I believe. Here you go, boy. Thank you.
{/dialog}

{dialog 39}
{instant}{npc:691}
Hm? Mighty young to be hunting marks, aren't
you, boy? Well, good for you, I say!{wait}
I heard a party of adventurers who had recently
passed through the Nabreus Deadlands mention
seeing a hellish golem.{wait}
Please...Nabradia was once my home. I cannot
bear to see it profaned so. And this golem...
No. No, surely it is not...{wait}
Would you kill this golem for an old man?

{item}Accept{/item}
{item}Decline{/item}
{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 40}
{instant}{npc:691}
Yes, that's the spirit. Never lose it. Now, as
for this golem, it roams somewhere beyond tall
grasses and a bank of thick fog.{wait}
It is known as the {color:gold2}Roblon{color:none}. It was my son, who—
no, no. Go now, and take care.
{/dialog}

{dialog 41}
{instant}{npc:691}
What's the matter? Get cold feet, my boy?
I'm usually a good judge of character, but
I overestimated you...
{/dialog}

{dialog 42}
{instant}{npc:691}
I've heard a hellish golem roams the Nabreus
Deadlands.{wait}
Please...Nabradia was once my home. I cannot
bear to see it profaned so. And this golem...
No. No, surely it is not...{wait}
Would you kill this golem for an old man?
{choice}
{item}Accept{/item}

{dialog 43}
{instant}{npc:691}
A party of adventurers who had passed through
Nalbina mentioned seeing a hellish golem known
as the {color:gold2}Roblon{color:none}.{wait}
The Roblon roams the {color:gold}Nabreus Deadlands{color:none} beyond
a place of tall grasses and a bank of thick fog.
You must put an end to this terror.
{/dialog}

{dialog 44}
{instant}{npc:691}
My son and I developed that golem for the good
of Nabradia. We never meant for it to do harm...{wait}
That seems a different life now. Hard to believe
so much has happened in these two short years.
{/dialog}

{dialog 45}
{instant}{npc:690}
Oh hoh! You've slain Goliath! Tell me everything
about it, and don't leave out a thing!{wait}
Yes, yes...amazing! I've not seen or heard the like!
{/dialog}

{dialog 46}
{instant}{npc:690}
Ah, Jovy! What timing! Listen to this!
{/dialog}

{dialog 47}
{instant}{npc:673}
Yes, master Barrong, what is it?
More news of your "secret" bestiary?
{/dialog}

{dialog 48}
{instant}{npc:690}
No need to be sarcastic, Jovy. But yes, it's
about the bestiary. I've finally added that page
on Goliath!{wait}
Incredible, no? He's the one who helped me
gather the information I needed. Your plan to
use hunters worked perfectly!
{/dialog}

{dialog 49}
{instant}{npc:673}
{italic}(snort){/italic}
{/dialog}

{dialog 50}
{instant}{npc:690}
I'll never understand that Jovy. Well, I'll show
him the bestiary later, I suppose.{wait}
I never thought I'd see such a rare beast
grace the pages of my bestiary...I couldn't
be happier! Thanks!
{/dialog}

{dialog 51}
{instant}{npc:690}
Oh yes, that last adventurer was good, quite
good. My pages grow in number, heh heh heh.
{/dialog}

{dialog 52}
{instant}{npc:690}
!?{wait}
Y-You! You were watching me! Here to send me
back to my workshop, are you?{wait}
What's this... You're just an ordinary adventurer.
Ah yes, an adventurer. An adventurer...
{/dialog}

{dialog 53}
{instant}{npc:690}
Could I chew your ear for a moment? I promise
not to hold you long.{wait}
I am a writer of bestiaries by hobby and trade.
Nalbina is an excellent place to pick the brains
of wandering adventurers as they pass.{wait}
The trouble comes in learning of more rare,
powerful beasts. Half who see them run, and the
other half never make it back. Quite a quandary.{wait}
So the idea struck me to petition hunts for
these monsters...not bad, eh?{wait}
Oh, you're here about my bill for {color:gold2}Goliath{color:none}?
Splendid! Splendid!{wait}
You're willing to go and fight this monster, eh?

{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 54}
{instant}{npc:690}
There's a good lad! I'll tell you what I know,
though it's precious little.{wait}
{color:gold2}Goliath{color:none} is a golem that walks the halls of the
{color:gold}Necrohol of Nabudis{color:none}. They say it's most
easily found when entering from the Deadlands.{wait}
It's fierce, and dangerous. But what's a little
danger in exchange for another page to add to my
bestiary, eh? Good luck!
{/dialog}

{dialog 55}
{instant}{npc:690}
Krah! Who asked you, anyway!
{/dialog}

{dialog 56}
{instant}{npc:690}
I've been interested in writing bestiaries since
I was just a boy. That's why I need to find out
more about {color:gold2}Goliath{color:none}!{wait}
You're willing to go and fight this monster, eh?
{choice}
{item}Accept{/item}
{item}Decline{/item}
{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 57}
{instant}{npc:690}
My bestiary won't be complete until I've written
a page about {color:gold2}Goliath{color:none}.{wait}
It's been spotted in the {color:gold}Necrohol of Nabudis{color:none}, near
the entrance to the Deadlands.{wait}
Don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing you can't
handle! Hurry back now...I want to hear every
little detail!
{/dialog}

{dialog 58}
{instant}{npc:690}
Don't talk to anyone but Jovy and me about the
bestiary, all right? I'm not ready to show it to
anyone else yet. What if they laughed?
{/dialog}

Y-You know what? Y-You're my new hero!

Y-Y'know what? Four years ago, in Rabanastre,
I got accused of stealing, but I didn't steal
nothin', honest! {italic}(snort){/italic}{wait}
The chap what saved me back then, he's my

My original hero, he had just lost his parents.
Sad, huh? But he was still looking out for his
younger brother. Nice guy! {italic}(snort){/italic}

Reagents align, impurities fade...{waitn1:2}
Flow stabilizes, energy minimal...{waitn1:2}
Structure... steady...

Proceeding carefully...{waitn1:2}
Vessels steady, heat drives distillation...{waitn1:2}
Essence separates, traces fade...{waitn1:2}
Distillate... stable...
{/dialog}

{dialog 169}
{instant}Researcher
Focus now...{waitn1:2}
Catalyst reacts, bonds shift...{waitn1:2}
Matrix adapts, transformation holds...{waitn1:2}
Synchronization... almost...
{/dialog}

{dialog 170}
{instant}Researcher
Wait... I see no traces of bound essence...{waitn1:2}
It appears {color:gold}{macro:7,0,1,0}{color:none} holds no elemental bond.
Nothing can be done with it.{wait}
What would you like to do now?
{choice}
{item}Try another.{/item}
{item}That will be all.{/item}
{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 171}
{instant}Researcher
Wait... I see no traces of alchemical process...{waitn1:2}
It seems {color:gold}{macro:7,0,1,0}{color:none} bears no refined qualities.
Nothing can be done with it.{wait}
What would you like to do now?
{choice}
{item}Try another.{/item}
{item}That will be all.{/item}
{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 172}
{instant}Researcher
Ah... another day in this barren hold.
The war is done, yet its scent lingers.{wait}
They say Nalbina is reborn, and perhaps so,
but for those who serve, little has changed.{wait}
I was sent from Archades to aid the troops,
yet the supply chain lies in ruin.{wait}
Without reagents, there is no progress.
I've awaited shipments for months.{wait}
My apologies, but I can do nothing now.
{/dialog}

{dialog 173}
{instant}Researcher
Ah... you again. A traveler, no doubt?
Passing through, as all others do.{wait}
Few linger long in Nalbina's shadow,
and fewer still find reason to return.{wait}
And speaking of reasons... I have many,
wearied as I am by this place.{wait}
They once claimed this post fit research,
yet truth be told, it was but exile.{wait}
At first they sent reagents to appease,
now only dust and silence remain.{wait}
And without reagents, there is no alchemy.
Even my tools have grown weary here.
{choice}
{item}Maybe I can help.{/item}
{item}Sounds like your problem.{/item}
{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 174}
{instant}Researcher
Heh... aye, I suppose it is indeed.
Can't blame you. None care for this place.{wait}
The war ended for some, not for all.{wait}
We shall meet again, traveler.
Mayhap things will change... or fade away.
{/dialog}

{dialog 175}
{instant}Researcher
You would aid me? Hah... bold indeed.
With proper reagents, I shall resume my work.{wait}
Yet there is always a cost.
See that soldier there? Lurking for his {italic}"cut"{/italic}, no doubt.
To keep them quiet, I must buy their silence.
{color:lightblue}{macro:12,0,0,0}{color:none} gil shall suffice.{wait}
A high price, I know... but peace is never cheap.
Shall you place faith in an old dreamer?
{choice}
{item}I'll handle it.{/item}
{item}I'm out!{/item}
{/choice}
{/dialog}

{dialog 176}
{instant}Researcher
Heh... aye, fair enough. 'Tis no small sum.
But giving up is what they expect of us.{wait}
Should you change your mind, you'll find me here,
amid empty flasks and hollow hopes.{wait}
Sometimes, I think only dust remains.
{/dialog}

{dialog 177}
{instant}Researcher
Ah... it seems you lack the coin.
Return when you do, I shall be ready.{wait}
Eager, even, to begin once more.
{/dialog}

{dialog 178}
{instant}Researcher
Excellent. I knew I could count on you.
With this, my lab shall breathe again.{wait}
You shall not regret this, I'll prove my worth.
Soon you'll witness the true splendor of my craft.{wait}
Ah, it has been long since these halls knew purpose.
Mayhap fate smiles upon us once more.{wait}
I'll call on old allies and gather my tools.
Return later, and you shall see progress.{wait}
Perhaps science yet endures in Nalbina.
{/dialog}

{dialog 179}
{instant}Researcher
Ah, too soon. Preparations remain.
Rare parts, costly reagents,{wait}
and soldiers too curious for comfort.
Return in due time. It shall be worth it.
{/dialog}

{dialog 180}
{instant}Researcher
At long last, all is ready.
It took some effort to gather my tools and reagents.
Feels less a lab and more a humble workshop, eh?{wait}
Hmm... perhaps I'll call it that from now on.
The reagents stir, the formulas awaken.{wait}
Now begins the true art of alchemy.
I can refine essences, distill metals,{wait}
and weave the threads of transmutation.
All depends on what you bring, traveler.{wait}
Now then... shall we see what alchemy can do?
{/dialog}

{dialog 181}
{instant}New supplies have arrived at the workshop!
{/dialog}

{dialog 182}
{instant}Researcher
Ah... new tools and utensils just arrived.
Some flasks and crude stabilizers, yet useful.{wait}
The workshop stirs, if only faintly.
{/dialog}

{dialog 183}
{instant}Researcher
At last! Finer tools have just arrived!
Schematics, formulas, and proper instruments.{wait}
The workshop truly begins to take shape.
{/dialog}

{dialog 184}
{instant}Researcher
Incredible! Master tools have just arrived!
Diagrams, catalysts, and a true athanor stand ready.{wait}
At last... the workshop stands in full splendor.
