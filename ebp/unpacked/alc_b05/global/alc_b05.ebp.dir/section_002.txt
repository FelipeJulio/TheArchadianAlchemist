{dialog 1}
{instant}Letter
You find a letter on the table. It reads:{wait}
"I know my days grow short. I regret only that
I shall not have the opportunity to return that
item entrusted to me all these many years.{wait}
"I have divided it into four pieces, in hopes
this might prevent it falling easily into
searching hands.{wait}
"I have enclosed the whereabouts of one of the
four, in the event its rightful owner should
come seeking to recover it.{wait}
"Stop the water's flow, then loose it once more.
East Southeast East Southwest Southeast
I pray that it rest there undisturbed."

I always thought sky pirates were supposed to
steal sky. There's no sky in Lowtown...it all made
sense. I've got a lot of thinkin' to do...
{/dialog}

{dialog 3}
{instant}{npc:636}
Can you believe we got our very own hideout?
All by ourselves, too! Well...maybe we had a
{italic}little{/italic} help from you.{wait}
There must be {italic}somethin'{/italic} we're better at than
you...and we'll find it!
{/dialog}

{dialog 4}
{instant}{npc:629}
Wow... Look at all the books... No fair.
Since I'm here, I guess I may as well read 'em!{wait}
Maybe they'll write a book about you someday,
Vaan. Better do lots of extra heroic things,
just to make sure.
{/dialog}

{dialog 5}
{instant}{npc:48}
Remember that kid you helped out of here? Well,
he said that me and the others could use the
place, if we wanted to.{wait}
This'll be our very own hideout! Just think of all
the plottin', schemin', and craftin' we can do!
...Did I mention the plottin'?{wait}
I haven't decided if we're still gonna try to be
sky pirates or not. But whatever we do, we'll
give it our best!{wait}
So you don't have to worry 'bout us. If you still
wanna be a sky pirate, we'll be rootin' for ya!
{/dialog}

{dialog 6}
{instant}{npc:48}
I told ya, you don't have to worry 'bout us.
If you're doin' something you wanna do, that's
good enough for me.
{/dialog}

{dialog 7}
{instant}{npc:47}
Me and Filo formed a new club. We're the
Buccaneer's Battalion now! A battalion's
bigger than a brigade...isn't it?{wait}
We figure all of us together can take care of
ourselves even when you and Penelo aren't
around.{wait}
So now you two can go wherever you need to
without having to worry about watchin' after
us.{wait}
Just don't do anything too dangerous, okay?
I don't know what you're off doing, but make sure
to come back in one piece!{wait}
You'll always have a place to come back to.
Penelo too!
{/dialog}

{dialog 8}
{instant}{npc:47}
Really, Vaan, you don't need to worry about us.
Just be sure to come back and visit...and bring
lots of pirate loot!

My pop owns this place. He was lettin' it out to
somebody, but it's been empty for a while now.{wait}
When my pop heard about the kids helpin' out that
lady and the Imperial from the Sandsea, he said
they could use it.{wait}
They really liked that idea, so Deeg is happy.
You should stop by when you can.{wait}
You never did take that letter, though...
Well, doubt you need it now. {italic}(snort){/italic}

Started out Deeg hid in here for fear of that
ghost. But the more Deeg comes, the more Deeg
likes it. Kinda cozy. {italic}(snort){/italic}{wait}
My pop owns the place. He was lettin' it out to
somebody, but it's empty now.{wait}
Whoever used to live here left a letter on the
table. Deeg read it, but it doesn't make any sense.
You can have it, if you want.
{/dialog}

{dialog 12}
{instant}{npc:991}
My pop owns this place. He was lettin' it out to
somebody, but it's empty now.{wait}
Deeg thinks that letter on the table belonged to
him. Didn't make much sense, though... Maybe it's
some code about water or something?{wait}
Hmm... Maybe {italic}that's{/italic} it... {italic}(snort){/italic}
Deeg has an idea, but...better check it out first.
Come back in a little bit.
{/dialog}

{dialog 13}
{instant}{npc:991}
My pop owns this place. He was lettin' it out to
somebody, but it's empty now.{wait}
Deeg thinks that letter on the table belonged to
him. Didn't make much sense at first. But then Deeg
thought maybe it had something to do with water.{wait}
There are a bunch of gates that control the water
down in the waterway, but you need a key to work
'em. {italic}(snort){/italic}{wait}
Deeg {italic}did{/italic} see a moogle runnin' around
squeakin' something about a key...{wait}
Deeg may have seen him around town before. Maybe
you should try to find him. You never know...that
could be the key!
{/dialog}

{dialog 14}
{instant}{npc:991}
My pop owns this place. He was lettin' it out to
somebody, but it's empty now.{wait}
{italic}(snort){/italic} Really? You figured out that letter?{wait}
Deeg knew it had to do with those gates!
And that's a pretty neat bit of medallion you
found... Looks important. Wonder what it's for.
{/dialog}

{dialog 15}
{instant}{npc:991}
My pop owns this place. He was lettin' it out to
somebody, but it's empty now.{wait}
Seems a waste, little Deeg usin' it all by myself.
Better to let someone who could do something
with it have it. {italic}(snort){/italic}
